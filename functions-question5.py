# Question 5

# This question is in 2 parts. Submit the code of both the parts by writing them in the same file.


# Question (Part 1)

# Write a function named check_numbers which takes two numbers and then print "both are even" if both numbers are even (divide by 2) otherwise print "both numbers are not even".

# def check_numbers():
#     check_list=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
#     number=[9,18,27,6,5,54,3,2,11]
#     i=0
#     a=[]
#     b=[]
#     while i<len(number):
#         a.append(check_list[i]%2==0 and number[i]%2==0)
#         print(i,"both are even")
#             # a.append(number[i],"both are even")
#         b.append(check_list[i]%2==0 and number[i]%2!=0)
#         print([i],"not even")
#         i+=1
#     print()
  
# check_numbers()
